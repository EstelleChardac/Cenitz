# Restaurant website : CENITZ

Wild Code School : Project 1 >> Complete responsive website made with a team of 5 people.

We've learned how to work with GitHub and multiple branches.

Although fictitious, the Website is fully functional. 

It is a Website realized for a restaurant that we decided to named : CENITZ ( ... a tribute to a very beautiful beach of the Basque Country for those who have the chance to know it ! ).

We are fully aware that there will always be room for improvement in the future, but we are quite proud of the work done and that's why we put it online !
